# Cyberpunk Keyboard

This project was created to provide the necessary files and information to build a split Sofle V2 RGB keyboard, fully customized with the Cyberpunk 2077 theme.

## Expectations
Below is a GIF showcasing a 3D representation of how the keyboard should look once the project is completed.

## Files
The STL files available in the print_3d directory were designed for the keyboard case construction. They can be downloaded and used with a 3D printer. In my case, I used the Ender 3 V3 KE model for printing.
